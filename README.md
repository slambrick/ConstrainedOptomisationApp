# ConstrainedOptomisationApp

This is the source code for a Shiny App that caculated signal level and optimal 
geometries for SHeM components based on the methods presented by [Bergin et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2019.112833).
The app itself is currently hosted [here](https://slambrick.shinyapps.io/constrainedoptomisationapp/).

The basic use of the app relies on the following equation for the spot size for a pinhole [scanning helium microscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_helium_microscopy).
such as that presented by [Barr et al. 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nimb.2014.06.028).
