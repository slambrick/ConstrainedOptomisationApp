This app calculates and plots the expected signal and resolution for a pinhole
scanning helium microscope (SHeM) for the provided rang of variables. One of the
first three variables plus the skimmer diameter must be fixed. The model assumes
that the skimmer size is the effective source size. The model is based on
combinations of Gaussian and was derived by
[M Bergin](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2019.112833). The model assumes
normal incidence. Click on the 2nd tab to generate an optimised geometry.

The equation below is what is used to calculate the beam standard deviation (*ϕ*)
based on the pinhole diameter (*d*), the working distance (*f*), the angular
source size (*β*) and the helium wavelength (*λ*).
