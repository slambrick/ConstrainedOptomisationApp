Here the signal optimised set-up for a pinhole microscope is calculated from a
set of specified inputs. As the optimal working distance is always 0 the used
working distance must be set, note it is the perpendicular working distance not the
beamline working distance. The derivation of the optimised configurations
was performed by [M Bergin](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2019.112833) and
has been slightly modified to include non-normal incidence by
[S Lambrick](https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.83463) (see appendix B).
